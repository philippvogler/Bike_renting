Predicting Bike Renting in Washington DC - Capstone Project  

Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project:  
Demand prediction of Capital Bike Share  

## PROJECT  
  
• Utilizing machine learning to forecast the demand for the Washington DC bike sharing system 'capital bike share'.  
• Using different types of regression to find an algorithm to predict the demand for bikes based on calendric and weather information.  
• This project tries to create a forecasting function based on two years of historical data by utilizing the machine learning libraries scikit-learn and tensor-flow.  

## DATA SET  

Weather, calendar and demand information is provided in a dataset by the University of Porto at UCI ML Repository:
