## Definition

### Project Overview
Student provides a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is given.

With my background in transport and logistics I went to find an interesting data set from the area. There are suprizingly few logistics and transportation data sets avalible. One however found my attantion. With the advent of the sharing economy transportation systems are transformed. Ownwership of a vehecile is not longer necassary. Service providers offer the acesses to  vehicle pool for cars of all sizes as well as bikes. Theses arrangement are interesting for residential customers as well as for tourists. The promiss to have a vehicle at your disposel, whenenver you need on and not to wory about upfront costs and maitenance. 
To fullfill this promis the service providers need to have ecxelent capacity planing capabilities. They have to forcast demand to shedule maintenence and provide the right amount of vehicles. So forecasting demand is of the essance to provide a atractive service. This is why I try to create a predictor for the customers demand of bicicles in the city of XY utelizing machine learning.

### Problem Statement
The problem which needs to be solved is clearly defined. A strategy for solving the problem, including discussion of the expected solution, has been made.

The goal is to develop a predictor that forecasts demand of bicicles on a dayly bases using weather and calander data. The demand is predicted using the weather forecast. This is a regressinon problem due to the continues nature of demand. The goal is to use tensor flowe to create a artificial neuronal network to solve ths task. Weather and calander data is used as features and the demand is the target variable. The data set is split into a training, validation and test set. Training and validaton set are used to refine the model and the test set will deliver the final result.

### Metrics
Metrics used to measure performance of a model or result are clearly defined. Metrics are justified based on the characteristics of the problem.
Student clearly defines a benchmark result or threshold for comparing performances of solutions obtained.

To measure the performance of the model and analyzing the error the mean-squared-error is most appropriate, because it is a regression model. To measure the quality of the regression model the distance between the prediction and the ground truth is calculated. There is no need for a „special“ distance measurement, so the euclidian distance will do. The error-distance is averaged over all training set cases. The squared error emphasizes the errors of outliers and therefor facilitated the learning process.

## Analysis

### Data Exploration
If a dataset is present, features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem have been reported and discussed, along with a sampling of the data. In lieu of a dataset, a thorough description of the input space or input data has been made. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that need to be addressed have been identified.

### Exploratory Visualization
A visualization has been provided that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data with thorough discussion. Visual cues are clearly defined.

### Algorithms and Techniques
Algorithms and techniques used in the project are thoroughly discussed and properly justified based on the characteristics of the problem.

### Benchmark
Student clearly defines a benchmark result or threshold for comparing performances of solutions obtained.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
All preprocessing steps have been clearly documented. Abnormalities or characteristics about the data or input that needed to be addressed have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, it has been clearly justified.

### Implementation
The process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data has been thoroughly documented. Complications that occurred during the coding process are discussed.

### Refinement
The process of improving upon the algorithms and techniques used is clearly documented. Both the initial and final solutions are reported, along with intermediate solutions, if necessary.

## Results

### Model Evaluation and Validation
The final model’s qualities — such as parameters — are evaluated in detail. Some type of analysis is used to validate the robustness of the model’s solution.

### Justification
The final results are compared to the benchmark result or threshold with some type of statistical analysis. Justification is made as to whether the final model and solution is significant enough to have adequately solved the problem.

## Conclusion

### Free-Form Visualization
A visualization has been provided that emphasizes an important quality about the project with thorough discussion. Visual cues are clearly defined.

### Reflection
Student adequately summarizes the end-to-end problem solution and discusses one or two particular aspects of the project they found interesting or difficult.

### Improvement
Discussion is made as to how one aspect of the implementation could be improved. Potential solutions resulting from these improvements are considered and compared/contrasted to the current solution.

## Quality

### Presentation
Project report follows a well-organized structure and would be readily understood by its intended audience. Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner. Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used to complete the project are cited and referenced.

### Functionality
Code is formatted neatly with comments that effectively explain complex implementations. Output produces similar results and solutions as to those discussed in the project.
